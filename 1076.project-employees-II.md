# 1076. Project Employees II

### Solution: HAVING, LIMIT

Get the maximum count of employees by ordering in descending order and limiting the results to 1 row.  
Select the project ids which have an employee count equal to the maximum count.  

```
SELECT project_id
FROM Project
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM Project
  GROUP BY project_id
  ORDER BY 1 DESC
  LIMIT 1
);
```
