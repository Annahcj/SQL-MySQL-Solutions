# 1715. Count Apples and Oranges

### Solution: Left Join, Coalesce
Left join Boxes with Chests using the `chest_id`.  
Use `coalesce` to select the count when there is a chest, and select 0 when there is no chest.

```
SELECT SUM(b.apple_count + COALESCE(c.apple_count, 0)) AS apple_count, SUM(b.orange_count + COALESCE(c.orange_count, 0)) AS orange_count
FROM Boxes AS b
LEFT JOIN Chests AS c USING(chest_id);
```
