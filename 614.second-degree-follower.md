# 614. Second Degree Follower

### Solution: Subquery

Select the followees and the count of followers only if the followee is also a follower in the table.  
We can count the number of followers by grouping by followee.  

```
SELECT followee AS follower, COUNT(1) AS num
FROM Follow
WHERE followee IN (
  SELECT follower
  FROM Follow
)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
