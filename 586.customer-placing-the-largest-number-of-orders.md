# 586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders

### Solution: Order by COUNT(*), Limit

Count the number of orders for each customer using `group by`.  
Order by the number of orders in desc order.  
Limit the results to 1 to get the 1st result.  

```
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Follow-up Solution: CTE

1. Create a cte `t`, which gets the number of orders of each customer using `group by`.
2. Select the maximum orders count from t.  
3. Select the customers from t where the orders count is equal to the max orders count. 

```
WITH t AS (
  SELECT customer_number, COUNT(*) AS orders
  FROM Orders
  GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT customer_number
FROM t
WHERE orders = (
  SELECT MAX(orders)
  FROM t
);
```
