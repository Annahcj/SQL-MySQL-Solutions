# 1699. Number of Calls Between Two Persons

The `IF` statement returns the second argument if the first argument is true, otherwise it returns the third argument.  

Use `IF` statements to order the `from_id` and `to_id` in ascending order, and group by them  
so that we can count the number of calls and get the sum of the duration between the two people.  

```
SELECT 
IF(from_id < to_id, from_id, to_id) AS person1,
IF(from_id < to_id, to_id, from_id) AS person2,
COUNT(*) AS call_count,
SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM Calls
GROUP BY 1,2;
```
