# 2066. Account Balance

### Solution: SUM Window Function, IF

Use an `IF` statement to select the positive amount if the type is deposit, and otherwise the negative amount.  
Get the sum of the amounts over transactions made by the same account and on dates less than or equal to the current date.  

```
SELECT account_id, day, 
SUM(IF(type='Deposit', amount, -amount)) OVER(PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY day) AS balance
FROM Transactions
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```
