# 1355. Activity Participants

### Solution: RANK window function, Left Join
Left join Activites with Friends to ensure we don't miss out the activities with no participants.  
Use the `RANK` window function to give a `min_rank` and `max_rank` ordered by the number of participants for each activity.  
`min_rank`: Ordered by the number of participants in ascending order.  
`max_rank`: Ordered by the number of participants in descending order.  

```
SELECT activity
FROM (
  SELECT activity, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*)) AS min_rank, 
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS max_rank
  FROM Activities
  LEFT JOIN Friends ON Friends.activity = Activities.name
  GROUP BY 1
) AS activity_rank
WHERE min_rank != 1 AND max_rank != 1;
```
