### Solution: Window Functions

1. Use `dense_rank` to get the rank of `visited_on`. 
2. Use the `SUM` window function to get the total amounts over the last 7 days.  
Only select the days where the rank is greater than or equal to 7.

```
SELECT visited_on, amount, ROUND(amount / 7, 2) AS average_amount
FROM (
  SELECT visited_on, SUM(amount) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 6 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS amount, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY visited_on) AS rk 
  FROM Customer
) AS avgs
WHERE rk >= 7
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
