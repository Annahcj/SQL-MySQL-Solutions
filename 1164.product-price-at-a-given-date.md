# 1164. Product Price at a Given Date

`Left join` `Products` with the `product_id`'s and latest `price`'s before or on 2019-08-16.  
`Left join` is necessary because if there is no price change before 2019-08-16, we need to set the default price as 10.  

```
SELECT DISTINCT p1.product_id, IFNULL(latest_price.price, 10) AS price
FROM Products AS p1
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT product_id, new_price AS price
  FROM Products
  WHERE (product_id, change_date) IN (
    SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date)
    FROM Products
    WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
    GROUP BY product_id
  )
) AS latest_price
ON p1.product_id = latest_price.product_id;
```
