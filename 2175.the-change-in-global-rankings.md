# 2175. The Change in Global Rankings

### Solution: ROW_NUMBER window function, Cast to Signed
Use two `ROW_NUMBER` window functions to get the rankings of each team before and after the points change.  
Subtract the two rankings to get the ranking change.    

```
SELECT team_id, name, 
CAST(ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY points DESC, name) AS SIGNED) - CAST(ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY points + points_change DESC, name) AS SIGNED) AS rank_diff
FROM TeamPoints
JOIN PointsChange USING(team_id);
```
