# 615. Average Salary: Departments VS Company

### Solution: CTE, AVG window function, LEFT, CASE

1. CTE `avg-salary`: Use `LEFT(pay_date, 7)` to get the month, and the AVG window function to get the average salary for each month.
2. Join Employee with Salary and avg_salary. Use CASE to get the comparison column.  
Note: The equality check for floating points initially returned an error, so use `CAST` to turn both to chars before comparing.

```
WITH avg_salary AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT LEFT(pay_date, 7) AS month, AVG(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY LEFT(pay_date, 7)) AS avg_salary
  FROM Salary
)

SELECT LEFT(pay_date, 7) AS pay_month, department_id, 
CASE
  WHEN CAST(AVG(amount) AS CHAR) = CAST(avg_salary AS CHAR) THEN 'same'
  WHEN AVG(amount) < avg_salary THEN 'lower'
  ELSE 'higher'
END AS comparison
FROM Employee
JOIN Salary USING(employee_id)
JOIN avg_salary ON LEFT(pay_date, 7) = month
GROUP BY 1,2;
```
