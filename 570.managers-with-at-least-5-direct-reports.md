# 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

### Solution: Inner Join

1. Create a table `managers` which gets the `managerId` and the count of employees/reports using `group by`.
2. Join `managers` with `Employee` to get the manager's name, only if the count of reports is bigger than 4.

```
SELECT Employee.name
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT managerId, COUNT(*) AS reports
  FROM Employee
  GROUP BY 1
) AS managers
JOIN Employee ON Employee.id = managers.managerId
WHERE reports > 4;
```
