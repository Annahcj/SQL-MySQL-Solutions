# 626. Exchange Seats

`LEAD` and `LAG`.  
If the id is an odd number, get the next id using `LEAD`. 
`LEAD` accepts a default value, so we can utilize that to return the same id if there is no next row.  
Otherwise, get the previous id using `LAG`.  

```
SELECT IF(mod(id, 2) = 1, LEAD(id, 1, id) OVER(ORDER BY id), LAG(id) OVER(ORDER BY id)) AS id, student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```
