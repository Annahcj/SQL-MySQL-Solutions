# 618. Students Report By Geography

### Solution: CTEs, ROW_NUMBER, Left Join

1. Create a cte for each continent, where each student is assigned a row number ordered by name.
2. Left join america with asia and europe. Group by the row number.

```
WITH america AS (
  SELECT name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) AS rk
  FROM Student
  WHERE continent = 'America'
),
europe AS (
  SELECT name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) AS rk
  FROM Student
  WHERE continent = 'Europe'
),
asia AS (
  SELECT name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) AS rk
  FROM Student
  WHERE continent = 'Asia'
)

SELECT america.name AS 'America', asia.name AS 'Asia', europe.name AS 'Europe'
FROM america
LEFT JOIN asia ON asia.rk = america.rk
LEFT JOIN europe ON europe.rk = america.rk
ORDER BY america.rk;
```
