# 2020. Number of Accounts That Did Not Stream

### Solution: YEAR & NOT IN

Use `YEAR` to get the year from a date.  
Only select the `account_id` if the `start_date` and `end_date` include some time in 2021. e.g: 2020 to 2022 still counts.  
Use a subquery to select the accounts with a `stream_date` in the year 2021.  
The `account_id` must not exist amongst these accounts.  

```
SELECT COUNT(account_id) AS accounts_count
FROM Subscriptions
WHERE YEAR(start_date) <= '2021' AND YEAR(end_date) >= '2021' AND account_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT account_id
  FROM Streams
  WHERE YEAR(stream_date) = '2021'
);
```
