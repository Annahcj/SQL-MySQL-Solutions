# 1811. Find Interview Candidates

### Solution: CTEs, group by contest_id - rank

This solution satisfies the follow up: any medal in n or more consecutive contests.

1. Create a cte `all_medals` that divides the three medals into three separate medals.
2. Create a cte `condition1` that selects the id, contest_id, and difference (contest_id - rank)
3. Join the `Users` table with condition1 and all_medals to get the name and mail.  
Group by id and diff to count the number of consecutive contests.  

```
WITH all_medals AS (
  SELECT contest_id, gold_medal AS id 
  FROM contests
  UNION
  SELECT contest_id, silver_medal AS id
  FROM contests
  UNION 
  SELECT contest_id, bronze_medal AS id
  FROM contests
),
condition1 AS (
  SELECT id, contest_id, contest_id - RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY contest_id) AS diff
  FROM all_medals
)

SELECT name, mail
FROM Users
JOIN condition1 ON id = user_id
GROUP BY id, diff
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 # replace 3 with n for follow-up
UNION
SELECT name, mail
FROM Users
JOIN (
  SELECT gold_medal AS id
  FROM Contests
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING COUNT(contest_id) >= 3
) AS gold_medals ON id = user_id;
```
