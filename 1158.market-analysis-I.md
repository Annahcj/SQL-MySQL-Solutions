### Solution: Left Join

Left join `Users` with `Orders` and group by `user_id` to get the total orders.  
Use `YEAR` to get the year from the `order_date`.  

```
SELECT user_id AS buyer_id, join_date, COUNT(order_date) AS orders_in_2019
FROM Users
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.buyer_id = Users.user_id AND YEAR(order_date) = '2019'
GROUP BY user_id;
```
