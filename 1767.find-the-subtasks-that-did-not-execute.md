# 1767. Find the Subtasks That Did Not Execute

### Solution: Recursive CTE

`cte`:  
base case: each `task_id` and a `subtask_id` of 1 from `Tasks`.  
Keep joining the cte with itself by selecting the `task_id` and `subtask_id` + 1 until it exceeds the `subtasks_count` for that task.

```
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
  SELECT task_id, 1 AS subtask_id
  FROM Tasks
  UNION ALL 
  SELECT task_id, subtask_id + 1
  FROM cte
  JOIN Tasks USING(task_id)
  WHERE subtask_id < subtasks_count
)

SELECT task_id, subtask_id
FROM cte
WHERE (task_id, subtask_id) NOT IN (
  SELECT *
  FROM Executed
);
```
