# 580. Count Student Number in Departments

### Solution: Left Join & COUNT(student_id)
Left join `Department` with `Student` using the department id.  
Group by department name to count the number of students.    
However, in the case where a department has 0 students, we can't simply use `COUNT(*)`.  
So, we have to use `COUNT(student_id)` to count the students.  

```
SELECT dept_name, COUNT(student_id) AS student_number
FROM Department
LEFT JOIN Student USING(dept_id)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1;
```
