# 1747. Leetflex Banned Accounts

### Solution: Join with itself

Join LogInfo with itself on three conditions:  
1. Shares the same account id.
2. Login time is between another account's login and logout time.
3. IP address if different.

```
SELECT DISTINCT l1.account_id
FROM LogInfo AS l1
JOIN LogInfo AS l2 
ON l1.account_id = l2.account_id 
AND l1.login BETWEEN l2.login AND l2.logout
AND l1.ip_address != l2.ip_address;
```
