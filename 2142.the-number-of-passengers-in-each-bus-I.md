# 2142. The Number of Passengers in Each Bus I

### Solution: CTE
1. For each passenger, get the minimum `arrival_time` of the buses which arrive after or at the same time as the passenger.  
2. Count the number of passengers for each bus by using `group by`.

```
WITH temp AS (
  SELECT passenger_id, MIN(Buses.arrival_time) AS arrival_time
  FROM Passengers
  JOIN Buses ON Buses.arrival_time >= Passengers.arrival_time
  GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT bus_id, COUNT(passenger_id) AS passengers_cnt 
FROM Buses
LEFT JOIN temp USING(arrival_time)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
