# 1264. Page Recommendations

### Solution: IN, NOT IN, CASE

1. Use a subquery to select the friends of user 1. 
2. Use another subquery to select the pages which were liked by user 1. 
3. Select the pages liked by a user existing in the first subquery and where the page_id does not exist in the second subquery.

```
SELECT DISTINCT page_id AS recommended_page
FROM Likes
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT
  CASE
   WHEN user1_id = 1 THEN user2_id
   WHEN user2_id = 1 THEN user1_id
  END AS friend_id
  FROM Friendship
  WHERE user1_id = 1 OR user2_id = 1
) 
AND page_id NOT IN (
  SELECT page_id
  FROM Likes
  WHERE user_id = 1
);
```
