Inner join the three tables by:
1. The `caller_id` or `callee_id` equal to the `id` in `Person`
2. The first three digits of the `phone_number` equal to the `country_code` in `Country`  
Where the country has an average calls duration larger than the global average calls duration.  

```
SELECT Country.name AS 'country'
FROM Calls
JOIN Person ON Calls.caller_id = Person.id OR Calls.callee_id = Person.id
JOIN Country ON LEFT(Person.phone_number, 3) = Country.country_code
GROUP BY Country.name
HAVING AVG(Calls.duration) > (
  SELECT AVG(duration) 
  FROM Calls
);
