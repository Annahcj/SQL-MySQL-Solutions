# 1596. The Most Frequently Ordered Products for Each Customer

### Solution: Subquery & RANK window function

Use the window function `RANK` to give each product a rank based on the number of orders it had for each customer.  
Select the product only if the rank is 1.

```
SELECT customer_id, product_id, product_name
FROM (
  SELECT customer_id, product_id, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rk
  FROM Orders
  GROUP BY 1, 2
) AS temp
JOIN Products USING(product_id)
WHERE rk = 1;
```
