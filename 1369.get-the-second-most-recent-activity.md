# 1369. Get the Second Most Recent Activity

### Solution: ROW_NUMBER, COUNT, Subquery
Assign a row number for each row ranked by startDate in descending order (with the same username).  
Additionally, each row must have the total count of rows with the same username (so that we can get the 1st row is there is only 1 row).  

```
SELECT username, activity, startDate, endDate
FROM (
  SELECT username, activity, startDate, endDate,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY username ORDER BY startDate DESC) AS row_num,
  COUNT(username) OVER(PARTITION BY username) AS total_count
  FROM UserActivity
) AS a
WHERE (total_count > 1 AND row_num = 2) OR (total_count = 1 AND row_num = 1);
```
