# 1225. Report Contiguous Dates

### Solution: Group by date - rank date

Get the rank of each date, and add the rank to the date 2019-01-01.  
Get the date diff between the date and the ranked date.  
Find the minimum date and maximum date for each interval by grouping by this date diff.  

```
SELECT 'failed' AS period_state, MIN(fail_date) AS start_date, MAX(fail_date) AS end_date
FROM (
  SELECT fail_date, DATEDIFF(fail_date, ADDDATE('2019-01-01', INTERVAL RANK() OVER(ORDER BY fail_date) DAY)) AS diff
  FROM Failed
  WHERE fail_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
) AS fail_diff
GROUP BY diff
UNION 
SELECT 'succeeded' AS period_state, MIN(success_date) AS start_date, MAX(success_date) AS end_date
FROM (
  SELECT success_date, DATEDIFF(success_date, ADDDATE('2019-01-01', INTERVAL RANK() OVER(ORDER BY success_date) DAY)) AS diff
  FROM Succeeded
  WHERE success_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
) AS success_diff
GROUP BY diff
ORDER BY 2;
