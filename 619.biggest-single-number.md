# 619. Biggest Single Number

### Solution: Subquery, Having, Max

Aggregate functions return null if there are no rows.  
1. Select the nums that have a count of 1 using `group by` and `having`.
2. Select the maximum number with `max`.  

```
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
  SELECT num
  FROM MyNumbers
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
) AS nums;
```
