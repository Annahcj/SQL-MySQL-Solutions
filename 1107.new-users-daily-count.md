# 1107. New Users Daily Count

### Solution: Subquery, DATEDIFF

1. Create a temp table 'first_login' which extracts the first login date for each user.  
2. Select the login dates and the count of users by grouping by the login date.  
Since we should only select dates which have more than one first-time login users, it would make sense to only select from the 'first_login' table.  

```
SELECT first_login_date AS login_date, COUNT(user_id) AS user_count
FROM (
  SELECT user_id, MIN(activity_date) AS first_login_date
  FROM Traffic
  WHERE activity = 'login'
  GROUP BY 1
) AS first_login
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-06-30', first_login_date) <= 90
GROUP BY 1;
```
