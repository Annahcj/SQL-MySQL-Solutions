### Solution: Subquery, Inner Join

Join `Project` with `Employee` using the `employee_id`.  
Select the maximum years of experience of an employee for each project.  
Only select the rows where the years of experience is equal to the maximum years of experience for each project.  

```
SELECT project_id, employee_id
FROM Project
JOIN Employee USING(employee_id)
WHERE (project_id, experience_years) IN (
  SELECT project_id, MAX(experience_years) 
  FROM Project
  JOIN Employee USING(employee_id)
  GROUP BY project_id
);
```
