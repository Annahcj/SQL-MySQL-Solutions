# 534. Game Play Analysis III

Use self join where the `player_id` matches and the `event_date` is smaller than or equal to the current `event_date`.  
Group by `player_id` and `event_date` to get the sum of `games_played`.

```
SELECT a.player_id, a.event_date, SUM(b.games_played) AS games_played_so_far
FROM Activity AS a, Activity AS b
WHERE a.player_id = b.player_id AND b.event_date <= a.event_date
GROUP BY 1,2;
```
