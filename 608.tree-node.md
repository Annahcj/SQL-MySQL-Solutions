# 608. Tree Node

Use a case statement to check for the different types of nodes.  

If the `p_id` is null, then it is a root.  
If the `id` is in the list of `p_id`'s (meaning they are another node's parent), then it is a inner node.  
Otherwise, it is a leaf node.  

```
SELECT id,
CASE
  WHEN ISNULL(p_id) THEN 'Root'
  WHEN id IN (
    SELECT p_id
    FROM Tree
  ) THEN 'Inner'
  ELSE 'Leaf'
END AS type
FROM Tree
ORDER BY id;
```
