## 1270. All People Report to the Given Manager

Recursive CTE works almost like iteration.  
Each iteration of the recursive part operates only on the rows produced by the previous iteration.  

We are first selecting employees who are directly connected to the the boss.  
Then, we are working backwards to find all employees who are connected to the initially directed connected employees.  

```
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
  SELECT employee_id
  FROM Employees
  WHERE manager_id = 1 AND employee_id <> 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT a.employee_id
  FROM Employees a 
  JOIN cte ON cte.employee_id = a.manager_id
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```
