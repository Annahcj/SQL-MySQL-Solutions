# 1126. Active Businesses

### Solution: CTE, AVG window function

1. temp: For each business, mark the activity as 1 (is active) or as 0 (not active).  
Find the average occurence for the activity using the AVG window function.
2. Select the `business_id`s which have a sum of active activities larger than 1.

```
WITH temp AS (
  SELECT business_id, IF(occurences > AVG(occurences) OVER(PARTITION BY event_type), 1, 0) AS active
  FROM Events
)

SELECT business_id
FROM temp
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(active) > 1;
```
