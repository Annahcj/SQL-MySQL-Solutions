# 1555. Bank Account Summary

### Solution: CASE statement, SUM, Left Join

1. Left Join `Users` with `Transactions` if either the `paid_by` of `paid_to` is equal to the `user_id`.
2. Use a case statement to get a negative amount when the user is paying, and a positive amount when the user is receiving. Sum it to get the credit.  
In case the user has no transactions, make sure to set the default case to 0.  
3. If the total credit is below 0, credit limit is breached.

```
SELECT user_id, user_name,
 SUM(
  CASE
   WHEN paid_by = user_id THEN -amount
   WHEN paid_to = user_id THEN amount
   ELSE 0
  END
 ) + credit AS credit,
 IF(SUM(
  CASE
   WHEN paid_by = user_id THEN -amount
   WHEN paid_to = user_id THEN amount
   ELSE 0
  END
 ) + credit < 0, 'Yes', 'No') AS credit_limit_breached
FROM Users
LEFT JOIN Transactions ON paid_by = user_id OR paid_to = user_id
GROUP BY 1;
```
