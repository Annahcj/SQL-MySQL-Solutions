# 1194. Tournament Winners

### Solution: CTE, RANK window function, CASE

1. Create a cte `scores` which gets the total score for each player along with their `group_id`.
2. Use the `RANK` window function to give each player a rank within their group.
3. Only select the players who have a rank of 1.

```
WITH scores AS (
  SELECT group_id, player_id, 
  SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN first_player = player_id THEN first_score
      WHEN second_player = player_id THEN second_score
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS score
  FROM Players
  JOIN Matches ON Matches.first_player = player_id OR Matches.second_player = player_id
  GROUP BY 1,2
)

SELECT group_id, player_id
FROM (
  SELECT group_id, player_id, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY group_id ORDER BY score DESC, player_id) AS rk
  FROM scores
) AS ranking
WHERE rk = 1;
```
