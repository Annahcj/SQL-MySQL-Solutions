# 177. Nth Highest Salary

We can make use of `limit` and `offset` to select the nth highest salary.  
However, `offset` can only take numeric contants, so we need to declare a new variable `m` with the value of `n - 1`.  
We also utilize `IFNULL` to return `NULL` if the nth highest salary doesn't exist.  

```
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;
SET M = N - 1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
    IFNULL(
      (
        SELECT DISTINCT salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET M
      ),
      NULL
    )
  );
END
```
