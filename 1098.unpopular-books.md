# 1098. Unpopular Books

### Solution 1: Left Join, Having, If

`Left join` Books with Orders because the book may not be in orders, but still needs to be included in the answer.  
Get the book where the sum of all orders greater than '2018-06-23' is less than 10.  
Use `IF` to select sum of the book quantities if the order is within a year, otherwise 0.

```
SELECT Books.book_id, Books.name
FROM Books
LEFT JOIN Orders USING(book_id)
WHERE Books.available_from <= '2019-05-23'
GROUP BY book_id
HAVING SUM(IF(dispatch_date > '2018-06-23', quantity, 0)) < 10;
```

### Solution 2: Not In

Simply `IN` wouldn't work because some books don't even have one order within a year.  
Therefore, we get the books within a year which have a quantity sum bigger than or equal to 10.

```
SELECT book_id, name
FROM Books
WHERE book_id NOT IN (
  SELECT book_id
  FROM Orders
  WHERE dispatch_date > '2018-06-23'
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING SUM(quantity) >= 10
) AND available_from <= '2019-05-23';
```
