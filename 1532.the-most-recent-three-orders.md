# 1532. The Most Recent Three Orders

### Solution: RANK window function

Use the `RANK` window function to give each order a ranking number.  
Only select the orders which have a rank of 3 or smaller.  

```
SELECT name AS customer_name, customer_id, order_id, order_date
FROM (
  SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_date, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS rk
  FROM Orders
) AS top3
JOIN Customers USING(customer_id)
WHERE rk <= 3
ORDER BY 1, 2, 4 DESC;
```
