`Left join` `Department` with `Employee` based on the `departmentId`.  
Only get the row if the `salary` is equal to the maximum salary for the department.  

```
SELECT Department.name AS 'Department', Employee.name AS 'Employee', Employee.salary AS 'Salary'
FROM Department
LEFT JOIN Employee ON Department.id = Employee.departmentId
WHERE Employee.salary = (
  SELECT MAX(Employee.salary)
  FROM Employee
  WHERE Employee.departmentId = Department.id
);
