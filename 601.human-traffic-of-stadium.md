# 601. Human Traffic of Stadium

### Solution: CTE, Self Join, Union
1. Create a cte containing all the ids of rows that match the conditions. Use self join to compare table with itself.  
Each row of the cte will contain: `id1`, `id2`, `id3`  
2. Separate the three ids of each row of the cte.  
From  
row1: `id1`, `id2`, `id3` to  

row1: `id1`, all info for id1  
row2: `id2`, all info for id2  
row3: `id3`, all info for id3  
Use inner join to get the information using the id.  

```
WITH consecutive AS (
  SELECT a.id AS id1, b.id AS id2, c.id AS id3
  FROM Stadium AS a, Stadium AS b, Stadium AS c
  WHERE a.id = b.id - 1 AND b.id = c.id - 1 
  AND a.people >= 100 AND b.people >= 100 AND c.people >= 100
)

SELECT Stadium.id, Stadium.visit_date, Stadium.people
FROM consecutive
JOIN Stadium ON consecutive.id1 = Stadium.id
UNION
SELECT Stadium.id, Stadium.visit_date, Stadium.people
FROM consecutive
JOIN Stadium ON consecutive.id2 = Stadium.id
UNION
SELECT Stadium.id, Stadium.visit_date, Stadium.people
FROM consecutive
JOIN Stadium ON consecutive.id3 = Stadium.id
ORDER BY visit_date;
