# 176. Second Highest Salary

Select the second highest distinct salary from the employee table.  
We utilize `IFNULL` to return `NULL` if the nth highest salary doesn't exist.

```
SELECT IFNULL(
(
  SELECT DISTINCT salary
  FROM Employee
  ORDER BY salary DESC
  LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
),
  NULL
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```
