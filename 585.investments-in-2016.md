# 585. Investments in 2016

### Solution: IN, GROUP BY
1. Get the counts of the `tiv_2015`s by grouping by `tiv_2015`. Only select rows with a count larger than 1.
2. Get the counts of the (lat, lon) by grouping by (lat, lon). Only select rows with a count equal to 1.
3. Select the sum of `tiv_2016` where the `tiv_2015` exists in the first subquery and `(lat, lon)` exists in the second subquery.

```
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
  SELECT tiv_2015
  FROM Insurance
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
  SELECT lat, lon
  FROM Insurance
  GROUP BY 1,2
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```
