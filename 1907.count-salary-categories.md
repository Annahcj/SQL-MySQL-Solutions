# 1907. Count Salary Categories

For each table, count the number of rows where the salary is in a specific category (low, average, or high salary).  
Union the three tables together.

```
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM Accounts
  WHERE income < 20000
) AS accounts_count
UNION
SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category, (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM Accounts
  WHERE income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000
)
UNION
SELECT 'High Salary' AS category, (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM Accounts
  WHERE income > 50000
);
```
