# 1965. Employees With Missing Information

### Solution: Union & Not In
#### Difference between Union & Union All: Union extracts the distinct rows, whereas Union All extracts all rows including duplicates.
We can make use of `union` here to return the distinct `employee_id`s.  
* Get `employee_id`s from Employees which are not present in Salaries.  
* Get `employee_id`s from Salaries which are not present in Employees.  

```
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (
  SELECT employee_id
  FROM Salaries
)
UNION
SELECT employee_id
FROM Salaries
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (
  SELECT employee_id
  FROM Employees
)
ORDER BY 1;
```
