# 1159. Market Analysis II

### Solution: CTE, Left Join, Rank

1. items_rank: Gets the `seller_id`, `item_id`, and rank of the item for the seller ordered by `order_date`.
2. Left join `Users` with `items_rank` and `Items`, where the rank of the item is 2.  
Use the `IF` clause to select yes if the item brand is their favorite brand, and no if it isn't.  

```
WITH items_rank AS (
  SELECT seller_id, item_id, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY seller_id ORDER BY order_date) AS 'rk'
  FROM Orders
)

SELECT user_id AS seller_id, IF(Items.item_brand = Users.favorite_brand, 'yes', 'no') AS 2nd_item_fav_brand
FROM Users
LEFT JOIN items_rank ON Users.user_id = items_rank.seller_id AND items_rank.rk = 2
LEFT JOIN Items USING(item_id);
```
