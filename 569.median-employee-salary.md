# 569. Median Employee Salary

### Solution: ROW_NUMBER window function

Use the `row_number` window function to give each employee a row number ordered by their salary.  
Only select the employees whose row number is in between n / 2 and (n / 2) + 1, where n is the number of employees in the company.  
e.g: if n is 7, select row numbers between 3.5 and 4.5 -> this only allows for the row number 4.  
if n is 6, select row numbers between 3 and 4 -> allowing for 3 and 4, the two medians.

```
SELECT id, company, salary
FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY company ORDER BY salary) AS row_num, COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY company) AS 'n'
  FROM Employee
) AS salary_rank
WHERE row_num BETWEEN n / 2 AND (n / 2) + 1;
