# 1204. Last Person to Fit in the Bus

### Solution: SUM() OVER
Calculate the cumulative sum of weight by using `SUM(weight) OVER(ORDER BY turn)`.  
Only take the rows which have a cumulative weight not exceeding 1000, and order by the cumulative weight in descending order.  
Limit the results to 1 to only get the first row.  

```
SELECT person_name
FROM (
  SELECT person_name, SUM(weight) OVER(ORDER BY turn) AS total_weight
  FROM Queue
) AS cumulative_weight
WHERE total_weight <= 1000
ORDER BY total_weight DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
