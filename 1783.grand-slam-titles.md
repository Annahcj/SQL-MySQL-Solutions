# 1783. Grand Slam Titles

### Solution: Sum, If, Join

Join `Players` with `Championships` if the `player_id` matches any of the championship names.  
Use `SUM` and `IF` statements to get the total count of championships for a player, as a player may have won more than 1 championship in a year.  

```
SELECT player_id, player_name, 
SUM(
  IF(Wimbledon = player_id, 1, 0) +
  IF(Fr_open = player_id, 1, 0) +
  IF(US_open = player_id, 1, 0) +
  IF(Au_open = player_id, 1, 0)
) AS grand_slams_count
FROM Players
JOIN Championships 
ON Wimbledon = player_id OR Fr_open = player_id OR US_open = player_id OR Au_open = player_id
GROUP BY 1;
