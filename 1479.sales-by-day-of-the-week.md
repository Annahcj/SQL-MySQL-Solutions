# 1479. Sales by Day of the Week

### Solution: Left Join, Sum, If, Weekday

Left join `Items` with `Orders` to get the order information for each unique `item_category`.  
Use `WEEKDAY` to get the day of the week from the `order_date`: Monday = 0, Tuesday = 1, ..., Sunday = 6.  
If the weekday matches a certain day of the week, count the quantity, otherwise count 0.  
Get the total sum with `SUM`.  

```
SELECT DISTINCT item_category AS Category,
  SUM(IF(WEEKDAY(order_date) = 0, quantity, 0)) AS 'Monday',
  SUM(IF(WEEKDAY(order_date) = 1, quantity, 0)) AS 'Tuesday',
  SUM(IF(WEEKDAY(order_date) = 2, quantity, 0)) AS 'Wednesday',
  SUM(IF(WEEKDAY(order_date) = 3, quantity, 0)) AS 'Thursday',
  SUM(IF(WEEKDAY(order_date) = 4, quantity, 0)) AS 'Friday',
  SUM(IF(WEEKDAY(order_date) = 5, quantity, 0)) AS 'Saturday',
  SUM(IF(WEEKDAY(order_date) = 6, quantity, 0)) AS 'Sunday'
FROM Items
LEFT JOIN Orders USING(item_id)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
