# 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

### Solution: Round, If, In

Only select the rows where the `order_date` is the minimum `order_date` for the customer.  
Calulate the percentage: sum of immediate orders / number of rows.  
Multiply the percentage by 100 and round to 2 decimal points.  

```
SELECT ROUND((SUM(IF(customer_pref_delivery_date = order_date, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
  SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
  FROM Delivery
  GROUP BY 1
);
```
