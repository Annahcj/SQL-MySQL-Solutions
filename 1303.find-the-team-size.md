# 1303. Find the Team Size

### Solution: Inner Join

1. Create a table `teamsize`, which gets the number of employees for each team using `group by`.
2. Join `Employee` with `teamsize` based on the team_id and get the team size from the `teamsize` table.  

```
SELECT employee_id, teamsize.size AS team_size
FROM Employee
JOIN (
  SELECT team_id, COUNT(*) AS size
  FROM Employee
  GROUP BY 1
) AS teamsize USING(team_id);
```
