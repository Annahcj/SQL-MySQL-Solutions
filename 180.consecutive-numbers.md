# 180. Consecutive Numbers

Utilize `LAG` and `LEAD`, which returns the value from the previous and next row respectively.  
Get the `distinct` numbers where the number is equal to the number at the previous and next row.  

```
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
  SELECT num, LAG(num) OVER(ORDER BY id) AS 'lag', LEAD(num) OVER(ORDER BY id) AS 'lead'
  FROM Logs
) AS l2
WHERE l2.lag = num AND l2.lead = num;
```
