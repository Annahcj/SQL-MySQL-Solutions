# 1949. Strong Friendship

### Solution: CTE, Inner Join

Create a cte which creates a two-way table using union: a -> b, b -> a.  
e.g: let's say we want to find the number of mutual friends for 1 and 2.  
1. Find all the friends of user1
2. Find all the friends of user2 who are also friends of user1
3. Group by `user1_id` and `user2_id` so that we can get the total count of friends.
4. Only select the row if the total count is bigger than 2.

```
WITH friends AS (
  SELECT user1_id, user2_id FROM Friendship
  UNION 
  SELECT user2_id, user1_id FROM Friendship
)

SELECT f1.user1_id, f1.user2_id, COUNT(*) AS common_friend
FROM Friendship AS f1
JOIN friends AS m1 ON f1.user1_id = m1.user1_id
JOIN friends AS m2 ON f1.user2_id = m2.user1_id AND m1.user2_id = m2.user2_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```
