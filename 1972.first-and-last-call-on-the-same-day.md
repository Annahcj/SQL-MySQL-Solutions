# 1972. First and Last Call On the Same Day

### Solution: CTE, UNION, FIRST_VALUE
1. Create a cte which keeps all the calls both ways: (caller_id, recipient_id) and (recipient_id, caller_id). We can achieve this by using `UNION`.
2. Select the first and last callers each day for each caller.
  * `FIRST_VALUE` returns the first value. To get the last value, we can use `FIRST_VALUE` and order in descending order.
3. Select the distinct callers where the firstCaller is equal to the lastCaller.

```
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT caller_id, recipient_id, call_time
  FROM Calls
  UNION
  SELECT recipient_id, caller_id, call_time
  FROM Calls
),
firstLastCallers AS (
  SELECT caller_id, FIRST_VALUE(recipient_id) OVER(PARTITION BY caller_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time) AS firstCaller, 
  FIRST_VALUE(recipient_id) OVER(PARTITION BY caller_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time DESC) AS lastCaller
  FROM cte
)

SELECT DISTINCT caller_id AS user_id
FROM firstLastCallers
WHERE firstCaller = lastCaller;
```
