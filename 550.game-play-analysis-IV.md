# 550. Game Play Analysis IV

### Inner Join, Round, Datediff.

Select the first login date for each player and inner join it with Activity.  
If the date diff for the first login date and another date is 1, count 1, otherwise 0.  
Use `SUM` to accumulate these values, then divide this sum with the total number of players.  

`ROUND` rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.  

```
SELECT ROUND(SUM(IF(DATEDIFF(b.event_date, a.event_date) = 1, 1, 0)) / COUNT(DISTINCT b.player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM (
  SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS event_date
  FROM Activity 
  GROUP BY player_id
) AS a
JOIN Activity AS b USING(player_id);
```
