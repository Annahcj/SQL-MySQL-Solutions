# 1875. Group Employees of the Same Salary

### Solution: Dense Rank, Not In
Use the `dense_rank` window function to get the `team_id` based on the salary.  
Only select the employees who don't have a unique salary by grouping by salary.  

```
SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary) AS team_id
FROM Employees
WHERE salary NOT IN (
  SELECT salary
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
ORDER BY team_id, employee_id;
```
