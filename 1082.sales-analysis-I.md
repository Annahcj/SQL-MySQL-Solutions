# 1082. Sales Analysis I

### Solution: Having, Group By

1. Get the max sales of a seller by grouping by `seller_id`, ordering in descending order, and limiting results to 1 row.
2. Get the sellers who have total sales equal to the max sales.

```
SELECT seller_id
FROM Sales
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(price) = (
  SELECT SUM(price)
  FROM Sales
  GROUP BY seller_id
  ORDER BY 1 DESC
  LIMIT 1
);
```
