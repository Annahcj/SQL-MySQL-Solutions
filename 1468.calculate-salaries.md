# 1468. Calculate Salaries

### Solution: CTE, Round, Case 

1. Create a CTE which selects the maxmimum salary for each company.
2. Use a case statement to decide the amount of tax to deduct from each salary.

```
WITH max_salary AS (
  SELECT company_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
  FROM Salaries
  GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT company_id, employee_id, employee_name, 
ROUND(salary - (
  (CASE 
   WHEN max_salary < 1000 THEN 0
   WHEN max_salary > 10000 THEN 0.49
   ELSE 0.24
  END))
  * salary
, 0) AS salary
FROM Salaries
JOIN max_salary USING(company_id);
```
