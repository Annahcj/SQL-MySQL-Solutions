# 574. Winning Candidate

### Solution: Inner Join & Temp Table
1. winningCandidate: Select the `candidateId` with the most votes by ordering by `COUNT(*)` in descending order and limiting the results to 1 row.  
2. Join `Candidate` with the temp table `winningCandidate` based on the id.

```
SELECT name
FROM Candidate
JOIN (
  SELECT candidateId
  FROM Vote
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
  LIMIT 1
) AS winningCandidate ON winningCandidate.candidateId = Candidate.id;
```
