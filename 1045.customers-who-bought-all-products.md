# 1045. Customers Who Bought All Products

### Solution: COUNT

Since the customer needs to have bought ALL products, we can just count the number of unique products a customer has bought.  
Select if it is equal to the number of products in the `Product` table

```
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM Product
);
```
