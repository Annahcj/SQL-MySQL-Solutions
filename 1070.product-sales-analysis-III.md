# 1070. Product Sales Analysis III

### Solution: Rank
Use the window function `rank` to rank the years.  
Select from rows where the year rank is 1.  

Note: The cte can be replaced with a nested query, but I prefer using a cte for readability.  
```
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY year) AS year_rank
  FROM Sales
)

SELECT product_id, year AS first_year, quantity, price
FROM cte
WHERE year_rank = 1;
```
