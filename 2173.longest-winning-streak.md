# 2173. Longest Winning Streak

### Solution: CTE, IFNULL, ROW_NUMBER window function
Assign two ranks to each match of each player,
1. Ranking for wins, draws, and losses.
2. Ranking for wins only.  

Consecutive wins can be found with the same result of 'group rank': General Rank - Wins Rank  
Find the maximum number of the same group rank for each player.  

In case a player has no wins, `right join` with the original table and use `IFNULL` to select 0 as a default.

```
WITH win_rank AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS rk
  FROM Matches 
),
group_rank AS (
  SELECT player_id, rk - ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS group_rank
  FROM win_rank
  WHERE result = 'Win'
),
streak_count AS (
  SELECT player_id, COUNT(*) AS streak
  FROM group_rank
  GROUP BY player_id, group_rank
)

SELECT player_id, IFNULL(MAX(streak), 0) AS longest_streak
FROM streak_count
RIGHT JOIN Matches USING(player_id)
GROUP BY 1;
```
