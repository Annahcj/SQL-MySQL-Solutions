# 1285. Find the Start and End Number of Continuous Ranges

### Solution: group by id - rank
e.g: 
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+
1: rank = 1, diff = 1 - 1 = 0.
2: rank = 2, diff = 2 - 2 = 0.
3: rank = 3, diff = 3 - 3 = 0.
7: rank = 4, diff = 7 - 4 = 3.
8: rank = 5, diff = 8 - 5 = 3.
10: rank = 6, diff = 10 - 6 = 4.

Find the min id and max id by grouping by the difference.  

```
SELECT MIN(log_id) AS start_id, MAX(log_id) AS end_id
FROM (
  SELECT log_id, log_id - RANK() OVER(ORDER BY log_id) AS diff
  FROM Logs
) AS diff
GROUP BY diff;
```
