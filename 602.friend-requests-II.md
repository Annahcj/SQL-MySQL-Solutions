# 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends

### Solution: Temp Table, Limit
Create a temp table which creates a two-way relationship between rows. e.g: 1 -> 2 to 2 -> 1.  
Use this temp table to count the number of rows which have the same `requester_id`.  
`Order by` the friends count and use `limit` to return the row with the highest friends count.  

```
SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM (
  SELECT requester_id, accepter_id FROM RequestAccepted
  UNION
  SELECT accepter_id, requester_id FROM RequestAccepted
) AS t
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Follow-up Solution: CTE

Create a cte `friends` which counts the number of friends for each person.  
Use a subquery to get the maximum friends count from `friends`.  
Select the rows which have a friends count equal to this maximum count.  

```
WITH friends AS (
  SELECT requester_id, COUNT(*) AS num
  FROM (
    SELECT requester_id, accepter_id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION
    SELECT accepter_Id, requester_id FROM RequestAccepted
  ) AS t
  GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT requester_id AS id, num
FROM friends
WHERE num = (
  SELECT MAX(num)
  FROM friends
);
```
