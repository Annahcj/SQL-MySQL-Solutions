# 1613. Find the Missing IDs

### Solution: Generate Consecutive IDs w/ Recursive CTE

1. Using a recursive CTE, generate all consecutive IDs from 1 to the max ID in Customers.  
2. Select the IDs which are not present in the Customers table.

```
WITH RECURSIVE allIds AS (
  SELECT 1 AS id
  UNION ALL
  SELECT id + 1 
  FROM allIds 
  WHERE id < (
    SELECT MAX(customer_id) 
    FROM Customers
  )
)

SELECT id AS ids
FROM allIds
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM Customers
);
```
