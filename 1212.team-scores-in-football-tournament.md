# 1212. Team Scores in Football Tournament

### Solution: Case, Left Join
1. Left join `Teams` with `Matches`.
2. Use a case statement to get the total goals:
  * Team is the host team AND had more goals: 3 points
  * Team is the guest team AND had more goals: 3 points
  * Host team had same score as guest team: 1 point
  * Any other case: 0 points

```
SELECT team_id, team_name, SUM(
CASE 
  WHEN team_id = host_team AND host_goals > guest_goals THEN 3
  WHEN team_id = guest_team AND guest_goals > host_goals THEN 3
  WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1
  ELSE 0
END
) AS num_points
FROM Teams
LEFT JOIN Matches ON team_id = host_team OR team_id = guest_team
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC, 1;
