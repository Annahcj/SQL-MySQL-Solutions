# 1097. Game Play Analysis V

`a`: the first login date for each player.  

`JOIN` a with Activity (b) based on the `player_id`.  
`installs`: the count of unique `player_id`.  
`Day1_retention`: If the datediff of the first login date and another date is 1, count 1, otherwise 0. Divide this sum with the count of unique `player_id` and round to two decimal places.  

```
SELECT a.event_date AS install_dt, COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) AS installs,
ROUND(SUM(IF(DATEDIFF(b.event_date, a.event_date) = 1, 1, 0)) / COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id), 2) AS Day1_retention
FROM (
  SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS event_date
  FROM Activity
  GROUP BY player_id
) AS a
JOIN Activity AS b USING(player_id)
GROUP BY 1;
