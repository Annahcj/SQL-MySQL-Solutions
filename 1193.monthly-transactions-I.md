# 1193. Monthly Transactions I

### Solution: LEFT, SUM, IF

Get the first 7 characters of `trans_date` by using `LEFT(trans_date, 7)`.  
Get the approved counts and total amount by using SUM(IF()), which counts the second argument is the condition is true, otherwise the third argument.    
Group by the month and country to get the counts and total sums.  

```
SELECT LEFT(trans_date, 7) AS month, country, COUNT(*) AS trans_count, 
  SUM(IF(state = 'approved', 1, 0)) AS approved_count,
  SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
  SUM(IF(state = 'approved', amount, 0)) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY 1, 2;
