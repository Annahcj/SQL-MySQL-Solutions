# 1083. Sales Analysis II

### Solution 1: Subquery, In, Not In

Use two subqueries:
1. Select the buyers who bought an S8
2. Select the buyers who bought an iPhone  
Only select the buyers who exist in the first subquery but NOT in the second subquery.

SELECT DISTINCT buyer_id
FROM Sales
WHERE buyer_id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT buyer_id
  FROM Sales
  JOIN Product USING(product_id)
  WHERE product_name = 'S8'
) AND buyer_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT buyer_id
  FROM Sales
  JOIN Product USING(product_id)
  WHERE product_name = 'iPhone'
);
```

### Solution 2: Having, If

Use an `IF` statement to count the number of products that are 'S8' or 'iPhone' under the same buyer.  
The buyer must have a count of S8s larger than 0 and count of iPhones equal to 0.

SELECT DISTINCT buyer_id
FROM Sales

GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(IF(product_name = 'S8', 1, 0)) > 0 AND SUM(IF(product_name = 'iPhone', 1, 0)) = 0;
```
