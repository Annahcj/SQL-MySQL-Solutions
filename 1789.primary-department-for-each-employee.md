# 1789. Primary Department for Each Employee


### Solution: NOT IN

Select the `employee_id` and `department_id` if:  
1. The `primary_flag` is Y
2. The employee has no primary flag Y (meaning only 1 department).

```
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR employee_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT employee_id
  FROM Employee
  WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
);
```
