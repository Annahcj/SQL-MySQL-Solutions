# 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

### Solution: SUM of frequency

smaller sum = sum of frequencies of smaller numbers  
bigger sum = sum of frequencies of bigger numbers  
A number is a median when the difference between the smaller sum and bigger sum is smaller than or equal to the frequency of the number.  
Since there may be two different medians, get the average of them.  

```
SELECT ROUND(AVG(num), 1) AS median
FROM (
  SELECT num, frequency, 
  SUM(frequency) OVER(ORDER BY num) AS smaller, 
  SUM(frequency) OVER(ORDER BY num DESC) AS bigger 
  FROM Numbers
) AS temp
WHERE frequency >= ABS(smaller - bigger);
```
