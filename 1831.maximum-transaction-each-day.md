# 1831. Maximum Transaction Each Day

### Solution: DATE(), IN
The DATE() function converts Datetime to Date.  
Select the `transaction_id` where the day and amount is in the the table of the max amounts for each day.   

```
SELECT transaction_id
FROM Transactions
WHERE (DATE(day), amount) IN (
  SELECT DATE(day), MAX(amount)
  FROM Transactions
  GROUP BY 1
)
ORDER BY 1; 
```
